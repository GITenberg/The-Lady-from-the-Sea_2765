description: Ibsen's lyrical and still startlingly modern masterpiece vibrantly explores
  the constrained social position of women. When the lighthouse keeper's daughter
  Ellida meets the widower Dr Wangel, she tries to put her long-lost first love far
  behind her and begin a new life as a wife and stepmother. But the tide is turning,
  an English ship is coming down the fjord, and the undercurrents threaten to drag
  a whole family beneath the surface in this passionate and sweeping drama. Ellida
  must choose between the solid and reliable values of the land and the fluid, mysterious
  and frightening attraction of the sea.
